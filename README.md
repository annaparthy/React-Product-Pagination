# React-Product-Pagination
🚀 **React Dynamic Pagination Project – Interview Challenge** 🚀

In a recent machine round interview challenge, we were tasked with implementing dynamic pagination in React using the **DummyJSON API** to fetch and display a list of products. The goal was to handle a large dataset efficiently and create a smooth user experience with pagination.

## Key Features:
- 🧑‍💻 **Data Fetching:** Fetches 500 products from the DummyJSON API using `useEffect`.
- 📑 **Pagination:** Displays 10 products per page with intuitive navigation buttons.
- ⬅️➡️ **Previous/Next Buttons:** Disables the "Previous" button on the first page and the "Next" button on the last page.
- 🔵 **Active Page Highlighting:** Current page is highlighted for better user experience.
- ✂️ **Slice Data:** Efficiently slices the products list for each page using array slicing.
- 🖼️ **Product Cards:** Custom `ProductCard` component that displays product image and title.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** The pagination and product cards adjust seamlessly on different screen sizes.

## Components:
- 🎨 **ProductCard:** A reusable component that takes product image and title as props.
- 🔢 **Pagination:** Custom pagination buttons that handle page navigation and active state styling.
- 🏠 **App:** Main component that integrates fetching, state management, and pagination logic.

## Tech Stack:
- ⚛️ **React:** For building dynamic and interactive UI.
- 🎨 **CSS:** For styling and layout.
- 📜 **JavaScript (ES6+):** For handling logic and state.

## Why It Matters:
- ⚡ **Performance-Optimized:** Handles large datasets efficiently with React’s state management and component structure.
- ✨ **User-Friendly UI:** Simplifies navigation through large lists with intuitive pagination controls.

This challenge helped solidify the understanding of state management and pagination in React, demonstrating effective problem-solving skills.
